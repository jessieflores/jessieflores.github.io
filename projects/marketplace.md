Manoa Marketplace is a web application that I helped develop as a team project in ICS 314, Fall 2017. The application is similar to craigslist but for UH manoa students with a direct message system implemented for inqueries. Manoa Marketplace is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. 


I helped create some of the mockups for the pages we were going to use as well as some of the content in our github organization page. In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. As this was the first time I worked on a project with a team, I learned how to work together as a team using github and slack to achieve a common goal.
