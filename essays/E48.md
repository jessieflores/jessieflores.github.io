Learning meteor, as a newbie, was a truly daunting experience. This was truly the first time that I was working on something that involves both client side and server side architecture. It was a difficult learning curve and especially so because I was also still relatively new to html or css/semantic ui so going to meteor was of course intimidating but also I was able to see the start of what you can really do through client/server. This module was where I felt the most that going through the readings or screencasts does not necessarily help you much. You need to just dive into this framwork, go through what works and what doesn't work, and famliarize yourself with meteor's syntax.
